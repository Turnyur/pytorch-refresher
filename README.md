## Pytorch refresher

### Overview
This repository is a playground where I refresh my knowledge of the PyTorch framework. It serves as a place to experiment with various neural network models and image classification problems, including:

- MNIST
- CIFAR
- Different neural network architectures
- Transfer learning
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
### Contents
